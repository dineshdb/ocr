\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our teachers Mr. Biswas Pokhrel and Mrs. Rama Bastola for providing their invaluable guidance, comments and suggestions throughout the course of the project. We would also like to thank the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering for providing us this golden opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts we have learned during the course that ultimately helped us in understanding the practical side of it.

We would also like to thank our friends and seniors who helped us in choosing the right tools, algorithms and techniques for the project. Also, we must acknowledge our deep sense of gratitude to the mentors of DN: AI Developers Nepal group and their AI Saturdays Meet Up which helped us to get started with our project and gain knowledge of various topics in AI.
