Optical Character Recognition systems solve the problem of digitizing handwritten or typed documents, forms, letters, etc. OCR systems are widely used to automate and speed up data entry process thereby reducing human errors. The OCR system developed by us has a web interface that is capable of taking input through a camera and giving the output of the recognized text to the user. A system capable of recognizing both handwritten and written English alphabets has been developed as part of this project. 

A four layer CNN architecture has been trained and used in order to classify the individual alphabets in the input. Further pre-processing and feature extraction of the input images is done using algorithms like MSER, Gaussian filters, etc. The input image is taken through the camera or through file upload to the system. The feature extraction part is then done to collect inputs for the trained model. The output given by the model is the recognized character output of the entire system.
An overall accuracy of 83\% has been observed with the system. Further improvements in the system can be made using a more robust set of features and a much larger dataset to improve the accuracy.
