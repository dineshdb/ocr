\chapter{Our Work}

\section{Our work}
For this project, we approached with divide and conquer. We tried to work on all the possible ways of solving the problem, shortlisted the possibilities (here, possible algorithms) and then all of us tried each of them. We wrote some scripts for training, trained the different models with datasets and observed the results. Then we compared the results with eachother. Then we compared the models. Again we tried to optimize the models with some parameter tuning. Then finally we compared the results and found that neural networks gave best efficienty and accuracy. Our initial model gave accuracy of 83\%. Later we were able to increase this efficienty to 86\% with more parameter tuning.

\section{Existing systems and comparision}
There are many Optical Character Recognition systems that are avaialble. However these systems are just command line tools or some kind of APIs that are not generally accessible to the end users. With this project we have tried to implement a front-end to the system that can talk to the backend(our API) and provide feedback to the end result. We have implemented the front-end in the web using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. As a result our front-end is also available accross the network. This makes the program more accessible and useful.
